Make a Bed and Breakfast class (BnB) that inherits a House class and uses a Hotel class as a interface.

The hotel class should have a "guests" variable as an integer.

The abstract house class should have a rooms variable as a integer and a function "ringDoorbell".

The Bnb class will need to implement the house properties.
